## Background and Motivation
The game of chess has been around for about 1500 years, but only just recently have we started documenting them. Chess notation was invented in 1866, but records of games were just personal or for use of tournaments. Now, we have access to databases of millions of casual games played online. This gives us huge insight into amateur strategies
